# Volvo Cars Integration for Hubitat

Connect your Hubitat Elevation¬Æ hub to your Volvo car(s) using the Volvo Cars API. Get vehicle status updates (lock status, fuel, battery, location, etc.) and send basic remote commands (lock, unlock, remote start/stop).

## üöÄ Evolution from hubitat-voc

This project represents the evolution of my previous work on Volvo integrations for Hubitat, specifically the hubitat-voc project (https://github.com/brianschmitt/hubitat-voc). While that earlier integration relied on unofficial methods to interact with Volvo services, this new integration is built to leverage the official Volvo Cars API available through the Developer Portal. Users currently using the hubitat-voc integration are strongly encouraged to migrate to this new version for a more official, maintainable, and potentially more stable connection to their vehicle. Please note that the setup process is different for this new integration as it requires obtaining an API key from the Volvo Developer Portal.

## ‚ú® Inspiration

This project is inspired by the excellent [thomasddn/ha-volvo-cars](https://github.com/thomasddn/ha-volvo-cars) integration for Home Assistant.

## Features

This integration installs as a Hubitat Parent App and creates Child Devices for each connected vehicle.

*   Manage multiple vehicles from the same Volvo ID account.
*   Poll vehicle status data:
    *   Door & Lock Status
    *   Window & Sunroof Status
    *   Fuel Level & Distance to Empty Tank
    *   Battery Charge Level & Electric Range (for applicable vehicles)
    *   Charging Status & Connection Status (for applicable vehicles)
    *   Odometer
    *   Last Known Location (Latitude, Longitude, Heading)
    *   Tire Status/Warnings
    *   Brake Fluid Status
    *   Oil & Coolant Level Warnings
    *   Service Interval Information (Distance/Time/Engine Hours)
    *   Warning Lights Status
    *   Trip Statistics (Average Consumption, Average Speed, Trip Meters)
*   Send Remote Commands (requires command accessibility status to allow the action):
    *   Lock / Unlock Doors
    *   Remote Engine Start / Stop
    *   Remote Climatization Start / Stop
    *   Honk Horn
    *   Flash Lights
    *   Honk & Flash
    *   Lock with Reduced Guard (if supported)
*   Supports Imperial unit conversion option for distance and consumption.
*   Configurable data refresh interval.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes & Limitations

*   **API Key Requirement:** You *must* obtain a VCC API Key from the [Volvo Cars Developer Portal](https://developer.volvocars.com/). You will need one API Key *per Volvo ID account*.
*   **Authentication Flow:** The current authentication flow requires your Volvo ID username and password, followed by an OTP sent to your email. This flow is specific to the integration's implementation based on observations of API interactions.
*   **API Rate Limits:** The Volvo API has rate limits (typically 10,000 requests per day per API key). The integration polls multiple endpoints for each vehicle during each refresh cycle. Choose your "Vehicle Data Refresh Interval" wisely (e.g., 10-15 minutes or longer) to avoid hitting this limit, especially if you have multiple vehicles.
*   **Future Features:** [Enhancements](ENHANCEMENTS.md)
*   **Supported Regions:** For a complete list of supported countries, check out [Volvo's API documentation on supported locations](https://developer.volvocars.com/terms-and-conditions/apis-supported-locations/).

## Requirements

1.  A Hubitat Elevation¬Æ Hub (running firmware 2.2.8 or later, as specified in `packageManifest.json`).
2.  A Volvo ID account with one or more vehicles linked.
3.  A Volvo Cars Developer Account (free).
4.  A VCC API Key generated from your Volvo Cars Developer Account. You need *one key per Volvo ID account* you wish to connect.

## Installation

Installation is recommended via Hubitat Package Manager (HPM).

### Via Hubitat Package Manager (Recommended)

1.  Install [Hubitat Package Manager](https://github.com/HubitatCommunity/HubitatPackageManager).
2.  In HPM, select `Install a User App`.
3.  Click `Add User Repository`.
4.  Enter the URL for this repository in the "Repository URI" field:
    `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brianschmitt/hubitat-volvo-cars/main/packageManifest.json`
5.  Click `Save`.
6.  Go back to the main HPM page and select `Install`.
7.  Find "Volvo Cars Integration" in the list, select it, and click `Next`.
8.  Confirm the components to install (the Parent App and the Child Driver) and click `Next`.
9.  Click `Install`.

### Manual Installation

1.  Go to your Hubitat hub's administrative interface. (You may also choose to use the import from url in the app/driver pages)
2.  Go to `Apps Code`.
3.  Click `New App`.
4.  Open the raw Groovy code for the app: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brianschmitt/hubitat-volvo-cars/main/app/volvo-cars-app.groovy`
5.  Copy the entire contents of the raw file.
6.  Paste the code into the Hubitat `New App` editor.
7.  Click `Save`.
8.  Go to `Drivers Code`.
9.  Click `New Driver`.
10. Open the raw Groovy code for the driver: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brianschmitt/hubitat-volvo-cars/main/drivers/volvo-cars-driver.groovy`
11. Copy the entire contents of the raw file.
12. Paste the code into the Hubitat `New Driver` editor.
13. Click `Save`.

## Setup and Configuration

1.  Go to your Hubitat hub's administrative interface.
2.  Go to `Apps` and click `Add User App`.
3.  Select "Volvo Cars" from the list. This opens the main configuration page.
4.  Click the "Manage Credentials & API Key" link.
5.  On the "Volvo Credentials & API Key" page:
    *   Enter your Volvo ID Username (Email) and Password.
    *   Enter your VCC API Key obtained from the [Volvo Developer Portal](https://developer.volvocars.com/account/#your-api-applications).
    *   Upon entering all required fields, the app will automatically attempt the first step of authentication.
6.  After successful submission, you will be directed to the "OTP Authentication" page.
7.  Check the email address associated with your Volvo ID. You should receive a 6-digit One Time Password (OTP).
8.  Enter the OTP code into the "OTP Code" field in the Hubitat app settings. Entering the code will trigger the next authentication step.
9.  If authentication is successful, you will be redirected to the "Manage Vehicles" page. The authentication status on the main page should show "Authenticated".
10. **Manage Vehicles:**
    *   On the "Manage Vehicles" page, the app will attempt to list the VINs associated with your authenticated Volvo ID.
    *   If VINs are found, select the desired VIN from the "Select Vehicle to add:" dropdown.
    *   Click the "Add Vehicle" button. (This process takes a few seconds to complete **be patient**)
    *   This will create a new child device under this app instance, representing your car. The device will be named "Volvo XXXX" where XXXX is the last 4 digits of the VIN. You can rename it on the device page later if desired.
    *   To remove a vehicle, click the "Remove [Vehicle Name] ([VIN])" link under "Existing Vehicles", then confirm on the next page.
11. **Configure Settings:**
    *   Go back to the main app page.
    *   Adjust the "Vehicle Data Refresh Interval" in the "Settings" section. Be mindful of the API rate limit (10,000 calls/day per key). **DEFAULT** Every 10 Minutes
    *   Enable "Enable debug logging" if you need detailed logs for troubleshooting. Logging automatically turns off after 30 minutes.
    *   On the individual child vehicle device page, you can also configure "Use Imperial Measurements" and "Remote Start Duration".

## Using the Vehicle Device

Once a child device is created for your vehicle, you can find it under `Devices`. Click on the device name (e.g., "Volvo 1234") to view its details page.

Here you will see:

*   **Current States:** This section displays all the attributes the driver exposes (fuel level, odometer, lock status, tire pressure, warnings, location, etc.) with their current values.
*   **Commands:** This section lists the commands you can send to the vehicle (e.g., `lock`, `unlock`, `refresh`, `startEngine`, `stopEngine`, `startClimatization`, `stopClimatization`, `siren` (honk), `strobe` (flash), `both` (honk & flash), `lockDoorsReducedGuard`).

You can use these attributes and commands in Hubitat apps like Rule Machine, Dashboard, and Hubitat Safety Monitor to automate actions or display information based on your vehicle's status.
